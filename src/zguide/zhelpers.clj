;; A: Because the most restrictive license on which it
;; depends is currently zeromq.zmq, and that's its license.
;; This probably isn't strictly required, and it gets finicky
;; when it comes to the EPL...I am going to have to get an
;; opinion from the FSF (and probably double-check with
;; the 0mq people) to verify how this actually works in 
;; practice.
